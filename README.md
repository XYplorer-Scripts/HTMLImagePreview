# HTML Image Preview

**Displays images in an HTML preview for [XYplorer](http://xyplorer.com/index.php).**

This script generates an HTML file to quickly preview images, and allows selecting images from this display. This exists mostly as an alternative to XYplorer's native preview and thumbnail features with the ability to show animated GIFs.

----------

#### Usage
1. [Download](./HTMLImagePreview.xys?raw=true)
2. Run
3. If the current selection or list pane contains images they will be shown.
4. [Optional] There are some configuration options which can be access by loading the script with ` Load 'HTMLImagePreview.xys', '*', 'f';`

#### Requires
+ XYplorer with scripting enabled.

+ Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64
